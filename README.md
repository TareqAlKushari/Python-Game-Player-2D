# Python Game Player 2D

A fun and interactive 2D game player built with Python! This project is ideal for learning game development fundamentals, experimenting with 2D graphics, or as a foundation for creating your own games.

## Overview

The **Python Game Player 2D** repository provides a simple yet extensible framework for running and developing 2D games in Python. It demonstrates core game development concepts such as sprite handling, collision detection, input processing, and rendering.

## Features

- 2D game engine built using Python
- Sprite movement and animation
- Collision detection and response
- Keyboard and/or mouse input handling
- Score tracking and game state management
- Easily extensible for custom levels or features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) or similar library (if used—check your requirements)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TareqAlKushari/Python-Game-Player-2D.git
   cd Python-Game-Player-2D
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If `requirements.txt` is missing, install [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) or any other required libraries manually.)*

### Usage

1. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   *(Replace `main.py` with your actual entry point if different.)*

2. **Follow the on-screen instructions to play!**
